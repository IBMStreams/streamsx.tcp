This package contains the following directories:

[All the directory references made below assume that your current directory is the
top-level folder of this toolkit i.e. MultiConnectionTCPServer]


1) Toolkit: This is a toolkit directory that contains the
com.ibm.streamsx.tcp::TCPServer operator - a multi-connection, multi-threaded
source operator that accepts text or binary data from one or more TCP sockets.

Description about this TCPServer operator is well documented in the following web browser friendly HTML file:
Toolkit/doc/com.ibm.streamsx.tcp.Multiconnection-Tcp-Server.html

You can see this toolkit at work by running the included sample applications (see item 2 below).

To build the toolkit, type:
cd Toolkit/impl
make
cd ..
make

2) Sample: Directory containing test applications that illustrate the use of the TCPServer operator. 

To build the sample, type:
cd Sample
make

This will build two different applications: 

a) TCPSender application which pumps data via different TCP sockets to be received by another application.
b) TCPReceiver application which invokes multiple TCPServer operator instances to receive the data sent from the sender application.

Start two Linux terminal windows.

At First, to run the TCP receiver application, type this on terminal window 1:
cd Sample 
./output/receiver/bin/standalone

After that, to run the TCP sender application, type this on terminal window 2: 
cd Sample
./output/sender/bin/standalone 

You can see the results from these tests in the Sample/data directory. You can stop
these applications after verifying the results by pressing Ctrl C in those terminal windows.
Browse the code for the test applications to understand how the TCPServer operator is used in different ways.
