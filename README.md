The IBMStreams/streamsx.tcp GitHub repository is home to the Streams TCP toolkit.
This toolkit contains a versatile C++ operator named TCPServer which is a multi-connection, multi-threaded 
operator that accepts text or binary data from one or more TCP sockets. This operator supports full duplex TCP communication and can accept and send data via a TCP socket connection.  It is ideal for ingesting and publishing data in
real-time from multiple remote TCP clients via a single source operator. This toolkit proved to be very useful in
many high performance commercial Streams engagements. 

If you are interested in taking advantage of this toolkit, you can start reading the following to understand the
technicalities about the TCPServer operator.
