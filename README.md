The IBMStreams/streamsx.tcp GitHub repository is home to the Streams toolkit named MCTS (Multi-Connection TCP Server).
This toolkit contains a versatile C++ operator named TCPServer which is a multi-connection, multi-threaded 
source operator that accepts text or binary data from one or more TCP sockets. It is ideal for ingesting data in
real-time from multiple remote TCP senders via a single source operator. This toolkit proved to be very useful in
many high performance commercial Streams engagements. 

If you are interested in taking advantage of this toolkit, you can start reading the following to understand the
technicalities about the TCPServer operator.
